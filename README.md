Secret Decoder with Polynomial Interpolation

## Overview

This project decodes a secret constant term from a polynomial using Lagrange interpolation based on provided roots. The roots are specified in a JSON format that includes their base and corresponding values. The program utilizes the **nlohmann/json** library for parsing JSON data.

## Features
- Decodes polynomial roots from various bases.
- Calculates the constant term using Lagrange interpolation.
- Flexible input options (from JSON file or command line).

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library (included in `include/json.hpp`)

  ## How to Run the Code

1. **Install a C++ Compiler**
   - Make sure you have a C++ compiler like g++ installed.

2. **Prepare the Input File** 
   - Ensure you have an `input.json` file in the folder.
  
3. **compile the code**
   
4. **Run the Program**

5. **Check the Output**
   - Look at the terminal for the output.
